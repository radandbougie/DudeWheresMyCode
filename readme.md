Jessica and Christina, two bumbling stoners, wake up one morning from a long night of coding and cannot remember where they saved their code, which prompts them on a journey to find it. Along the way, they encounter a variety of people who include their angry friends Wilma and Wanda whose house they trashed, an angry street gang, and a male stripper hounding them for a suitcase full of stolen money.
